# JoJoCRUD
A simple CRUD created with JoJo inspiration to polish backend skills with nodejs and expressjs.
This CRUD manages JoJo's Bizarre Adventures characters.
As of now name, stand, age and musical references are stored.
| Methods  | Description | Example | 
| ---------|-------------| -----|
| GET      | Gets every character by their id | ./chars/4 |
| POST     | Posts a new character using the info on the body | ./heroes/ |
| PULL     | Modifies an existing character by ID and replaces the existing info with the one on the body | ./heroes/1 |
| DELETE   | Deletes a character by ID | ./heroes/7 |

Next step is making a frontend for this CRUD with ReactJs or React Native
